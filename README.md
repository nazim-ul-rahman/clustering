# CLUSTERING
<i> Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning technique used for grouping similar objects or data points into clusters.<br>
The goal of clustering is to partition a dataset into subsets, or clusters, such that data points within the same cluster are<br>
more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.<br>

# Here are some key points about clustering:
<i>**Unsupervised Learning:**<br>
Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique, meaning that it does not require labeled data for training.<br>
Instead, it relies on the intrinsic structure of the data to identify patterns and groupings.<br>
 **Objective:**<br> 
The main objective of clustering is to find natural groupings or clusters in the data without prior knowledge of the class labels.<br>
Clustering algorithms seek to maximize the intra-cluster similarity and minimize the inter-cluster similarity.<br>
 **Types of Clustering Algorithms:**<br>
There are various clustering algorithms, each with its own approach and characteristics. Some common clustering algorithms<br>
include K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering (e.g., DBSCAN), and Gaussian mixture models (GMM).<br>
 **Cluster Representation:** <br>
Each cluster typically has a representative point or centroid that summarizes the characteristics of the cluster.<br>
The choice of representation depends on the clustering algorithm used.<br>
 **Evaluation:**<br> 
Clustering algorithms may require evaluation to assess their effectiveness in partitioning the data into meaningful clusters. <br>
Evaluation metrics such as silhouette score, Daviesâ€“Bouldin index, or within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) can be used to measure the quality of clustering.<br>
 **Applications:**<br>
Clustering finds applications in various fields, including customer segmentation, market analysis, image segmentation, document clustering,<br>
anomaly detection, and recommendation systems.<br>
 **Challenges:**<br>
Clustering can be challenging due to factors such as the curse of dimensionality, noisy or ambiguous data,<br>
and the subjective nature of defining similarity or distance metrics.
